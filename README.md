# Java CRUD Rest API with Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes

Welcome to the repository for building and deploying a Java CRUD Rest API using a robust tech stack. This project combines the power of Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes to create a scalable solution for managing data through RESTful services.

## Features

- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies Java application development.
- **Hibernate**: Widely adopted ORM framework for seamless database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Reliable relational database management.
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensures portability, consistency, and ease of deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Powerful container orchestration for advanced deployment, scalability, and maintainability.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to dive into the project:

1. **Java Application Setup**:
   - Utilize Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data, and Hibernate.
   
2. **MySQL Setup**:
   - Install the MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench on your local machine.

3. **Dockerization**:
   - Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the Java application and the database.

4. **Build and Deployment**:
   - Use Maven to build the Java app, create a Docker image, and run the container using Docker Compose.

5. **Testing**:
   - Validate the application with Postman and curl.
